# This section lists the regions defined in Zen's default page.html.twig and
# maintenance-page.html.twig files. The name before the semi-colon is the
# machine name of the region. The text after the semi-colon is the region's
# description used on the admin/structure/block page.
#
# In the page.html.twig, the contents of the region are output with a
# {{page.MACHINE_NAME}} variable. For example, with these lines in the .info.yml
# file:
#   regions:
#     header_top: Header top
# You'll use this variable in page.html.twig:
#   {{ page.header_top }}
